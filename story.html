        Excitedly, Lily and Ben awaited their guests' arrival, armed with beautifully cut invitations. As they chatted with Mr. Johnson, they learned how to add and subtract fractions with different denominators, making their festival preparations even smoother. By simplifying fractions, they ensured each invite was perfect, reflecting their newfound maths skills and artistic flair. With their invitations ready and their knowledge expanded, Lily and Ben eagerly anticipated a successful art festival ahead.
